Note: The requirements.txt file lists the dependencies required to run Cygnus. In this case, we need the nmap and scapy libraries, as well as the python-nmap library, which is a Python wrapper for Nmap.

Here's a brief explanation of each dependency:

    nmap: A powerful network scanning tool that provides information about hosts, services, and operating systems.
    scapy: A Python library for packet manipulation and network exploration.
    python-nmap: A Python wrapper for Nmap that allows us to use Nmap's functionality from within Python.

To install these dependencies, you can run the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


This will install the required libraries and their dependencies, allowing you to run Cygnus.
